// This class is everything you need to preform a Download Verification, which means everything that happens after you click a button which should download a file

// The current functionality is:
//      get default download directory, verify the latest existing file, if it was downloaded sucessfully store it
//      allow data comparison by reading CSV & excel files and comparing it to a specified grid
